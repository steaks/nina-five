# How to Play

##  Setup 
Form two teams of two players each. Sit in a square around the table. Players across from each other are partners. Choose one player to be the dealer.

Grab a standard 52-card deck plus 2 jokers. Deal 6 cards to each player. Then deal 1 face-down card to each team. These are the peekaboo cards. Players may look at their 6 cards. Players may not look at the peekaboo cards.

## Gameplay

### The Flop
Deals two community cards face up in the middle of the table. Community cards may be used by either team to build their poker hand.

### Player Turns (Flop Round)
Start with the player to the left of the dealer. And continue clockwise. On their turn each player plays one care face up in front of them.

### Peekaboo
After all four cards have been played each team may optionally replace one of their opponent's cards with their peekaboo card. Keep in mind that the peekaboo card is face down, so this is a risk. See the [peekaboo](#peekaboo) section for more details.

### The River
Deals a third community card face up next to the flop cards. Community cards may be used by either team to build their poker hand.

### Player Turns (River Round)
Start with the player to the left of the dealer. And continue clockwise. On their turn each player plays one face up card next to their previously played face up card. This will be the last time to play cards in the round.

### Form Hands
After all cards have been played each team has 7 cards (3 community cards and 4 player cards) to form hands. Each team forms their best 5 card hand.

### Score
Use the [scoring rules](#scoring) below to determmine which team won the trick. The team with the higher hand takes the trick. If this is a team's 6th trick then the team wins the game.

### Prepare for next Round
The dealer passes the deck to the player to their left. This is the new dealer.

If fewer then 3 hands have been played with the deck then deal 6 cards to each player and 1 peekaboo card to each team (following instructions in [setup](#setup) above). 

If 3 hads have been played with the deck re-shuffle the 52 cards + 2 jokers. Deal 6 cards to each player and 1 peekaboo card to each team (following instruction in [setup](#setup) above).

## Scoring

The first team to win 6 tricks wins the game. The team with the higher poker hands wins the trick. If teams have equal poker hands no team wins the trick.

| **Flush** | Any five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence | Compare highest card, then second highest, etc. |
| **Straight** | Five cards in a sequence, but not all of the same suit | Higher ranking straight wins. |
| **Three of a Kind** | Three cards of the same rank | Higher ranking three of a kind wins, followed by higher kicker cards |
| **Two Pair** | Two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank | Compare highest pair, then second pair, then kicker |
| **One Pair** | Two cards of the same rank | Higher pair wins. Compare kicker cards in descending order |

*Differences from standard poker:*

*There is no full house in this game. Five of a kind is possible with jokers*

## Peekaboo Card
Each team receives 1 face-down **peekaboo card**. The peekaboo card can only be used to replace one of the opponents' cards to ruin their poker hand. It is customary to say "peekaboo" when using the peekaboo card.

## Jokers  
Jokers are wild and can be used to represent any card. When a joker is played as a community card, each team decides what the joker represents at the end of the trick. When a joker is played by a player, the player must immediately choose the suit and rank for the joker.


## Table Talk  
Table talk is restricted. Players cannot reveal, hint, or discuss the cards in their hand. Communication is limited to non-specific strategy discussions, leaving more to the players' intuition and teamwork.
