# Rules

##  Setup 
Form two teams of two players each. And use a standard52-card deck plus 2 jokers.

Deal 6 cards to each player. Deal 1 face-down peekaboo card to each team. Player may look at their 6 cards. Players may not look at the peekaboo cards.

## Gameplay

### The Flop
The dealer deals two community cards face up in the middle of the table. Community cards may be used by either team to build their poker hand.

### Player Turns (Flop Round)
Straing with the player to the left of the dealer and moving clockwise, each player plays one card face up.

### Peekaboo Play
After all four cards have been dealt each team may optionally replace one of their opponent's cards with their peekaboo card.

### The River
The dealer deals a final third community card face up. Community cards may be used by either team to build their poker hand.

### Player Turns (River Round)
Straing with the player to the left of the dealer and moving clockwise, each player plays one card face up.

### Form Hands
There are now three community cards on the table. And each team has four additional cards. Each team forms the best 5 card hand from their available 7 cards.

### Winning the Trick
The team with the higher poker hand wins the trick. If both poker hands are equal, neither team wins the trick. See modified poker hands below for the order of poker hands.

### Prepare for next Round
The next dealer is the player to the left of the current dealer. If 3 hands have been played with the deck then re-schuffle and deal (following setup instructions above). If fewer then 3 hands have been played then repeat the gameplay instructions beginning with the flop.

## Scoring

The first team to win 6 tricks wins the game. The team with the higher poker hands wins the trick. If teams have equal poker hands no team wins the trick.

### Hands and Tie-Breakers
Nina Five uses modified poker hands. The following table shows the hand rankings and tie-breaker rules:

| Hand | Description | Tie-Breaker Rules |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Five of a Kind** | Five cards of the same rank (made possible with jokers) | Not possible to tie |
| **Royal Flush** | A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit | Split pot if tied (not possible unless using community cards) |
| **Straight Flush** | Five cards in a sequence, all of the same suit | Higher ranking straight flush wins |
| **Four of a Kind** | Four cards of the same rank | Highest kicker card decides winner |
| **Flush** | Any five cards of the same suit, but not in sequence | Compare highest card, then second highest, etc. |
| **Straight** | Five cards in a sequence, but not all of the same suit | Higher ranking straight wins. Split pot if identical straights |
| **Three of a Kind** | Three cards of the same rank | Compare remaining two kicker cards |
| **Two Pair** | Two cards of one rank and two cards of another rank | Compare highest pair, then second pair, then kicker |
| **One Pair** | Two cards of the same rank | Compare kicker cards in descending order |
| **High Card** | If no one has any of the above | Compare cards in descending order |

*Notes:* 
- There is no full house in this game
- When identical hands occur using all community cards, the pot is split
- Kicker cards are used to break ties when the primary hand values are equal
- Suits do not matter for breaking ties except in flush-based hands

## Peekaboo Card
Each team receives 1 face-down **peekaboo card**. The peekaboo card can only be used to replace one of the opponents' cards to ruin their poker hand. It is customary to say "peekaboo" when using the peekaboo card.

## Jokers  
Jokers are wild and can be used to represent any card. When a joker is played as a community card, each team decides what the joker represents at the end of the trick. When a joker is played by a player, the player must immediately choose the suit and rank for the joker.


## Table Talk  
Table talk is restricted. Players cannot reveal, hint, or discuss the cards in their hand. Communication is limited to non-specific strategy discussions, leaving more to the players' intuition and teamwork.
